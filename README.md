# Database Engineering Projects

Welcome to the **Database Infrastructure** repository! This collection is my personal playground for learning about database infrastructure, tooling, and automation. Each project is a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of how databases work behind the scenes and how to build tools that make working with them easier.
